This repository contains my NLP course projects as part of the Natural Language Processing course at Ben Gurion University of The Negev.  </br>
During the course I have implemented 4 projects, in which each one covers a different approach. </br>

The porjects were implemented in python 3.9, using Pytorch library.

## Projects
1. Language Modeling and Generation - The purpose of this assignment is to bring us up to speed with our Pythonian text manipulation skills, simple conditional probabilities and the power of simple language models.

2. Spell Checker - The purpose of this assignment is to give hands-on experience with probabilistic models of language by implementing the full algorithmic pipeline. 

3. Authorship Attribution - Use various algorithms for text classification, performing an authorship attribution task on Donald Trumpâ€™s tweets. The objectives are: to work with the sklearn and PyTorch library, to learn to design and interpret experiments in NLP (authorship recognition,classification),
and understand the differences between the various algorithmic frameworks and their application to different types of data.


4. POS Tagging - The purpose of this assignment is to implement a Hidden Markov Model and a BiLSTM model for Part of Speech tagging. The objectives of this assignment are: Better understanding of POS and HMM and generative sequence models, using multi-layer bi-LSTM model and extending the input representation for the LSTM tagger.
